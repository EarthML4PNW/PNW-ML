# PNW


## PNW Dataset
PNW datasets are made of two files: waveform and metadata. Download them using the link below. Note you may access the data directly from Google Colab. See `Google Colab` section below.
- waveform (waveforms.hdf5 ~35G): https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Ktee6VV4Nz6I0oo0IjGiW8BX_Zzb7wyE/view?usp=sharing
- metadata (metadata.csv ~19MB): https://drive.google.com/file/d/1TcG1Ey5pxMEZatPXiHufBK0XC_SgO1Bl/view?usp=sharing
- This dataset follows the structure of [seisbench](https://seisbench.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). See [here](https://seisbench.readthedocs.io/en/latest/pages/data_format.html) to learn more about the  file structure.

## Inspect Dataset
Here are two ways to look at PNW dataset. 
### Jupyter Notebook
A jupyter notebook is available to load and plot PNW dataset at [here](Inpect_PNW.ipynb). Download and run it on a local machine to enable the interactive plotting (e.g., zoom in/out).

### Google Colab
If you are more familiar with Google Colab, go [here](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1z6Ls_cj5cHu0ml_9DK3ExIm3b4EcNsg8#scrollTo=e61ac8cb). Note that interactive plotting  is not available. Please let me know if you have made interactive plotting works in Google Colab before.
