# PNW


## PNW Dataset
PNW datasets are made of two files: waveform and metadata. Download them using the link below. Note you may access the data directly from Google Colab. See `Google Colab` section below.
- waveform (waveforms.hdf5 ~35G): https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Ktee6VV4Nz6I0oo0IjGiW8BX_Zzb7wyE/view?usp=sharing
- metadata (metadata.csv ~19MB): https://drive.google.com/file/d/1TcG1Ey5pxMEZatPXiHufBK0XC_SgO1Bl/view?usp=sharing
- This dataset follows the structure of [seisbench](https://seisbench.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). See [here](https://seisbench.readthedocs.io/en/latest/pages/data_format.html) to learn more about the  file structure.
  

### Inspect Dataset
Here are two ways to look at PNW dataset. 
1. Jupyter Notebook
A jupyter notebook is available to load and plot PNW dataset at [here](inspect-PNW-dataset.ipynb). Download and run it on a local machine to enable the interactive plotting (e.g., zoom in/out).

2. Google Colab

If you are more familiar with Google Colab, go to the link above. Note that interactive plotting is not available. Please let me know if you have made interactive plotting works in Google Colab before.


## PNW ML Catalog
PNW ML Catalog is made of two parts: waveform and metadata. Download the metadata using the link below. Due to permission issue, links to download waveform are not available, but you can either access the data directly from Google Colab, or download waveform with ObsPy IRIS client. See `Google Colab` section below.
- waveform (waveforms.hdf5 ~66G)
- metadata (metadata.csv ~60MB): https://drive.google.com/file/d/1TcG1Ey5pxMEZatPXiHufBK0XC_SgO1Bl/view?usp=sharing

Similar to the dataset, a Colab notebook is available to work directly with the browser.
